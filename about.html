<h1>About</h1>
<p>

Hello. It is a great pleasure to have you here. This website serves as my personal blog. Here I will share my interest, discoveries, and side projects.

<br>

Please note that this is blog is still under constant construction. If you want to report anything, please contact me through email.

<br><br>

I like Minecraft, Paradox games, and quirky pixel games. Aesthetics, which arise from them, have constituted my most essential passion to learn and explore, serving as an indispensable guide to live my life, and offering me a purpose to overcome difficulties and challenges in my life. It is by basing on them, that I can develop my enthusiasm in every aspect of humans' studies.

<br><br>

It is hard for me to put a finger on what my aesthetics are. It is more of a mystical experience. I will share several images which in some ways that especially make me feel satisfied. If you can somehow resonate with me, we can be really alike.
